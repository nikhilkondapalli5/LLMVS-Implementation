This video documents a "#SILENCEISBETRAYAL" Sydney Flash Mob for Syria, held on May 19th, 2012, as a somber public demonstration to raise awareness about the conflict in Syria. Participants, many dressed in black, began their protest in a busy public area, suddenly dropping to the ground in a simulated act of oppression and violence. Throughout the performance, individuals were seen kneeling, crying, and being comforted, while others simulated being attacked, dragged, or having a foot placed on their head. The protesters held up numerous signs to highlight the humanitarian crisis, including calls to "OPEN YOUR EYES" and "FREE SYRIA", while directly condemning the Syrian president with signs like "BASHAR YOU TYRANT" and "ASSAD YOU MURDERER". Specific signage cited high casualty and refugee figures, and referenced the tragic case of "Hamza Al Khateeb, Age: 13 years old", who was allegedly tortured and killed. The event concluded with the unveiling of a large banner over a major road reading "SILENCE IS BETRAYAL" and the final onscreen message: "NOMORESILENCE FREE SYRIA”.
