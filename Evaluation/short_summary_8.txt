The video documents a group of friends and their dog, Wolf, facing an unexpected adventure in a snowy, rural area. After their first vehicle gets stuck in a large drift of hard, old snow on a remote path, the person filming concludes there is "no use digging this one out" and they decide to leave it. They walk back toward a second vehicle, referred to as the Subaru, which they then use to drive off-road through a snow-covered cornfield to get home. The rest of the drive is bumpy, loud, and filled with excitement and laughter, especially from the passengers in the back seat.
