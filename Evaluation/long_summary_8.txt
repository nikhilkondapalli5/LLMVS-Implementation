The video begins with a group of friends, bundled up against the cold, approaching a dark-colored minivan stuck fast in a snowdrift on a remote, snow-covered track. The person recording asks them to explain what happened, and they mention they were driving down the path and following their dog, named Wolf, when they hit the snowdrift and got stuck. They discuss the severity of the situation, noting that the snow is hard and old and that they are likely stuck for good, even attempting a brief, unsuccessful push of the vehicle. Ultimately, they decide to leave the stuck car and walk back, with the dog leading the way. The video then transitions as the group gets into a different, light-green minivan (referred to as the "Subaru" by the person filming, despite the vehicle's appearance), which successfully drives them across a snow-covered cornfield to bypass the impassable track. The drive is bumpy and filled with excitement and laughter as they race through the field, ending their unexpected off-road adventure.
