In this GMC Certified Service instructional video, Dave Campbell highlights the importance of regular tire maintenance to ensure vehicle safety and extend tire life. He explains that rotating tires every 7,500 miles or during oil changes is crucial for promoting even tread wear, allowing all four tires to be replaced simultaneously. The video demonstrates how to check for wear using a professional gauge or the "penny test"—noting that if you can see Lincoln's entire forehead when the coin is inserted into the tread, the tire needs replacing. Campbell also warns against the dangers of driving on bald or unbalanced tires, which can lead to vibrations and poor road grip, and concludes by advising owners to visit certified experts for proper diagnosis and replacement.
