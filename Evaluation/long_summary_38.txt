The video, presented by Jeff Edwards of the University of Wyoming Extension, discusses the Paper Wasp and how to manage its nests, particularly around homes and gardens. Edwards first points out that paper wasps are actually beneficial insects because they help control garden pests like caterpillars. However, their presence can be problematic because they are indiscriminate stingers when disturbed. Edwards recommends that when spring cleaning or gardening, homeowners should take the opportunity to remove any wasp nests found, especially those in the eaves of structures where they could pose a threat to people or pets. He demonstrates how a nest can be physically knocked down with a shovel or other implement and then thrown away. Alternatively, he suggests using chemical control specifically designed for wasp and hornet control. For chemical removal, he advises applying the product in the evening when all the wasps have returned to the nest, and then cleaning the dead wasps and the nest off the structure.
