The video, titled "How to Wheelie," is a tutorial on performing the bicycle trick known as a wheelie, which involves riding on the back wheel only. The host introduces the trick as the "Granddaddy of bike tricks," emphasizing that it's all about balance. A trick rider then demonstrates and explains the key steps. First, the rider must get comfortable pulling the front wheel up by pushing with their lead foot and leaning back. They suggest practicing this in an empty parking lot without using pedal straps for safety. The next crucial step is finding the balance point, which can be practiced by holding onto a wall. Finally, the tutorial combines these steps, advising the rider to gain forward speed, pull the front wheel up, push off with the lead foot, and lean back to lock into the balance point, maintaining the wheelie through a combination of shifting body weight and pedaling speed. The video concludes by encouraging viewers to practice and to engage with the show on social media.
