This video documents a Flash Mob in Sydney for Syria protesting the violence and conflict in the country, using the hashtag #SILENCEISBETRAYAL. The video, which features somber music and an urgent tone, shows a group of people in an urban public space demonstrating in support of the Syrian people. Many participants are dressed in black or wear black masks over their eyes, symbolizing perhaps the victims or the feeling of darkness surrounding the conflict. They hold signs with messages like "BUGGER OFF BASHAR!" and "HOW MANY MORE CHILDREN?" which refer to the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and the civilian casualties of the war. The demonstration includes an act of protest where individuals suddenly drop to their knees and cover their heads, and others are seen holding pictures of what appears to be a child victim. The video emphasizes the need to speak out against the atrocities and ends with a shot of a large banner being hung from a bridge, reinforcing the call for action.
