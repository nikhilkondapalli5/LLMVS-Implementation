The video addresses the most common question about fixed-gear bikes: "How do you stop?" While the host recommends using a front brake for safety and efficiency, it details three techniques for stopping without one, often done by experienced riders: the Skip Stop, the Skid Stop, and Back Pressure. The Skip Stop involves a slight jump to lift the rear wheel, causing it to skip and gradually slow down. The Skid Stop is a faster, but tire-wearing technique where the rider locks up the rear wheel, causing the bike to skid; this requires rising out of the saddle and positioning the pedals horizontally, pulling up with one foot and pushing down with the other. The easiest method is Back Pressure, where the rider applies reverse pressure to the pedals as they rotate, slowly bringing the bike to a stop. The video emphasizes that for all three techniques, having some form of foot retention (straps or clips) on the pedals is essential.
