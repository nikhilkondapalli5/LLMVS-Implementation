The video provides an instructional guide on how to perform a wheelie on a fixed-gear bicycle. It begins by emphasizing the need to get comfortable pulling the front wheel up. The rider is then instructed to push with their lead foot while leaning back. The video stresses the importance of continuous practice to maintain the wheelie. Once the rider is "locked in," the key to sustaining the trick is presented as a combination of shifting the body weight and controlling the speed of pedaling. This coordination of balance, movement, and speed is essential for executing and holding the wheelie.
